### üìò Project Title

**\[Brainwave]**

*Brainwave is a powerful and intuitive tool that leverages document and spreadsheet analysis to provide intelligent question-answering and data visualization capabilities. With Brainwave, users can upload documents (such as PDFs or text files) and Excel sheets, and the tool will extract meaningful information to answer any questions related to the content of those files.


### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About The Project

Provide a detailed description of your project:

* **Motivation**: In many fields, users often work with data-heavy files like reports or spreadsheets and struggle to extract meaningful answers or visual insights. The motivation behind creating Brainwave was to build a tool that can efficiently process documents and Excel files, allowing users to ask questions about the data and instantly generate visualizations (charts/graphs) to better understand it. Whether you're analyzing financial reports, research documents, or just want to visualize data in your spreadsheets, Brainwave offers an easy, interactive solution.
* **Built With**: Brainwave was built with a combination of powerful technologies to provide a seamless user experience:

    Python: The primary programming language for backend functionality and data processing.
    
    Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly with Excel files.
    
    Matplotlib / Seaborn: Libraries for generating various types of charts and visualizations from Excel data.
    
    Natural Language Processing (NLP): To answer questions based on the content of the uploaded documents and files.
    
    Streamlit : Framework for serving the application and handling the interaction with users.
